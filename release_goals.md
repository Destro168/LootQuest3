# LootQuest3 Release Goals for 1.0:

TODO:
- Implement ability to display content dynamically into the Floating Window components. (Pass entire components into them? Sure, why not)
- Implement 'fighter' data structures.
- Integrate player data structures into a floating window.
- Create a combat floating window to find new foes to fight and handle combat transitions.
- Create a floating window for enemies that display their stats too.
- Implement cheat window to begin to manipulate data freely.
- Implement actual combat mechanisms. (turn-based hits to the death)
- Implement inventory and equipment floating windows and systems. Allow drag and drop of items between the two windows to handle moving gear and such.
- Implement looting from combat.
- Implement World Map Feature to explore. Random fights start from world map.
- Add health potion drop from monsters for healing. Add ability to right-click in inventory to use them.
- Flesh out systems to have content for implemented systems up to level 10.
